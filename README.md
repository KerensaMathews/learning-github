# Dynamic Resume

A dynamic resume site built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery. Includes Google Maps integration.

This was a Udacity project designed to test and display JavaScript skills. The bulk of the project was built with JavaScript and jQuery, and resume contents can be seamlessly updated without having to modify anything but a few JavaScript objects.

I'm using this as my resume on my live portfolio site, which has a separate repository at KerensaMathews/portfolio-site.
