# Dynamic Resume

A dynamic resume site built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery. Includes Google Maps integration.

This dynamic resume was a Udacity project designed to test and display students' JavaScript skills. The bulk of the project was built with JavaScript and jQuery, and resume contents can be seamlessly updated without having to modify anything but a few JavaScript objects.

I'm using this as my actual resume on my portfolio site, which has a separate repository at KerensaMathews/portfolio-site.

## Development Notes

Recently added header and footer to include portfolio site navigation. Still adjusting main.css and resume.css for display issues, specifically to keep color background seamless and fix minor spacing issues.

Resume.css needs additional work to improve responsive function of resume.html.

Troubleshooting required to fix recent problem with map - location pins are no longer displaying.
