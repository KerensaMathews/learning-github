# Dynamic Resume

A dynamic resume site built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery. Includes Google Maps integration.

This was a Udacity project designed to test and display JavaScript skills. The bulk of the project was built with JavaScript and jQuery, and resume contents can be seamlessly updated without having to modify anything but a few JavaScript objects.

I'm using this as my resume on my live portfolio site, which has a separate repository at KerensaMathews/portfolio-site. (Separate repositories because they were originally separate projects with different purposes, skills tested, and languages used.) 

## Development Notes

9/25/17: Recently added header and footer for portfolio site navigation. 

~~- Still adjusting main.css and resume.css for display issues, specifically to keep color background seamless and fix minor spacing issues.~~
Display issues fixed in 11/5/17 update. Color background removed to maintain consistency across portfolio site.

~~- Resume.css needs additional work to improve responsive function of resume.html.~~
Fixed in 11/5/17 update.

~~- Troubleshooting required to fix recent problem with map - location pins are no longer displaying.~~
Fixed in 11/5/17 update.

11/5/17: Project can be considered complete for current use and purpose.

### Future

- Will adjust styling periodically, for the resume page individually and/or as part of a larger site redesign. 
- Will update resume sections with new information as necessary.
